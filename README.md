Data Extraction :
Data regarding books of different genre is to be extracted in .csv format from websites using web scraping

EDA :
The extracted data needs to be checked for missing values, duplicates, etc.Hence Exploratory data Analysis is performed on the dataset to view the changes

Feature Engineering :
FE is performed to prepare an input data set that best fits the machine learning algorithm as well as to enhance the performance of machine learning models.

Model Building :
A suitable model building technique based on accuracy is selected to build a working model of the recommendation system

Deployment :
The model developed is then deployed onto website using suitable medium like Heroku/Flask/Rshiny
